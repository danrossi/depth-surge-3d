## Medium Priority

### 🎯 Motion & Temporal Consistency
- ~~[PARKED]~~ Optical Flow Integration
  - **Status**: Fully implemented, tested, and intentionally NOT merged
  - **Branch**: `experimental/optical-flow-parked` (do not merge)
  - **Why parked**: Fundamental theoretical limitations (see EXPERIMENTAL_BRANCH_README.md on branch)
    - Post-hoc depth warping doesn't address root causes
    - V2 already has temporal consistency (32-frame windows)
    - 2D optical flow can't properly handle 3D depth changes
    - Error propagation, not error correction
  - **Lessons learned**: Use V2 for temporal consistency, not post-processing hacks
  - **Implementation quality**: Complete with 35 passing tests, full UI, metrics, logging
  - **Conclusion**: The right answer is "use V2", not "add optical flow"
- [x] V2 Temporal Window Tuning ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Experimental UI sliders for window size (16-64) and overlap (4-20)
  - Configurable via settings chain (UI → StereoProjector → VideoDepthEstimator)
  - Warning about quality impact when deviating from trained default (32 frames)
  - Allows memory/quality tradeoff experimentation

### ⚡ Performance Enhancements
- [x] GPU memory optimization ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Created vram_manager.py for VRAM detection and monitoring
  - Implemented smart batch sizing based on available memory
  - Chunk sizes auto-adjust: 4-24 frames based on VRAM and resolution
- [x] Parallel frame processing ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Stereo pair generation parallelized with multiprocessing.Pool
  - Uses cpu_count() - 2 workers for optimal performance
- [x] Cache depth maps across runs ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Implemented depth_cache.py with BLAKE2b content hashing
  - Caches in ~/.cache/depth-surge-3d/depth_cache
  - Skips re-computing if video and depth settings unchanged

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Real-time preview while processing ✓ (2026-01-18)
  - Shows current depth maps, stereo pairs, and VR frames via websocket
  - Configurable update frequency (1-5 seconds, default: 2s)
  - Toggle on/off in UI settings
  - Bandwidth-optimized: ~25-100 KB/sec, negligible performance impact

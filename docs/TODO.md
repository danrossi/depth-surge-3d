### 🎯 Motion & Temporal Consistency
- ~~[PARKED]~~ Optical Flow Integration
  - **Status**: Fully implemented, tested, and intentionally NOT merged
  - **Branch**: `experimental/optical-flow-parked` (do not merge)
  - **Why parked**: Fundamental theoretical limitations (see EXPERIMENTAL_BRANCH_README.md on branch)
    - Post-hoc depth warping doesn't address root causes
    - V2 already has temporal consistency (32-frame windows)
    - 2D optical flow can't properly handle 3D depth changes
    - Error propagation, not error correction
  - **Lessons learned**: Use V2 for temporal consistency, not post-processing hacks
  - **Implementation quality**: Complete with 35 passing tests, full UI, metrics, logging
  - **Conclusion**: The right answer is "use V2", not "add optical flow"
- [ ] V2 Temporal Window Tuning (better alternative to optical flow)
  - Investigate optimal window sizes for different content types
  - Test overlap percentages for best temporal consistency
  - Benchmark memory/quality tradeoffs

### ⚡ Performance Enhancements
- [ ] GPU memory optimization
  - Process frames in smaller batches to manage VRAM
  - Implement smart batch sizing based on available memory
- [ ] Parallel frame processing where possible
  - Depth estimation can be parallelized
  - Stereo generation can be parallelized
- [ ] Cache depth maps across runs
  - Skip re-computing depth if source video hasn't changed

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Real-time preview while processing
  - Show current frame being processed
  - Display depth map visualization
- [ ] Progress time estimates
  - Better ETA calculation based on actual frame processing time
- [ ] Drag-and-drop video upload
- [ ] Queue multiple videos for batch processing
- [ ] Resume interrupted processing automatically

### 🎛️ Advanced Settings
- [ ] Fine-tune stereo parameters per VR headset
  - Presets for Quest 2/3, Vive, PSVR2, etc.
- [ ] Custom depth model selection
  - Support multiple depth estimation models
  - Allow model switching without reinstall
- [ ] Advanced hole-filling algorithms
  - Depth-guided inpainting improvements
  - ML-based hole filling

## Low Priority

  - Equirectangular projection
  - Cubemap support

### 🧪 Experimental Features
- [ ] Dynamic depth adjustment
  - Auto-tune baseline/focal based on scene content
- [ ] Scene detection
  - Different 3D strength for different scene types
  - Cut detection to reset temporal models
- [ ] AI upscaling integration
  - Real-ESRGAN or similar for enhanced quality

### 📊 Analysis & Debugging
- [ ] Depth map quality metrics
  - Temporal consistency scoring
  - Edge coherence analysis
- [ ] Frame comparison tools
  - Side-by-side before/after viewer
  - Depth map visualization tools

## Documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with simplified architecture
  - Document Video-Depth-Anything as sole depth model
  - Remove serial/batch mode confusion
  - Update model loading information
  - Clarify memory requirements (loads all frames)
- [ ] Create VR headset compatibility matrix
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks by GPU
  - Video-Depth-Anything performance metrics
  - Memory usage for different video lengths

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Clean up commented debug code
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Add type hints throughout
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
  - Unit tests for image processing
  - Integration tests for full pipeline
  - Performance regression tests

## Medium Priority

### 🎯 Motion & Temporal Consistency
- ~~[PARKED]~~ Optical Flow Integration
  - **Status**: Fully implemented, tested, and intentionally NOT merged
  - **Branch**: `experimental/optical-flow-parked` (do not merge)
  - **Why parked**: Fundamental theoretical limitations (see EXPERIMENTAL_BRANCH_README.md on branch)
    - Post-hoc depth warping doesn't address root causes
    - V2 already has temporal consistency (32-frame windows)
    - 2D optical flow can't properly handle 3D depth changes
    - Error propagation, not error correction
  - **Lessons learned**: Use V2 for temporal consistency, not post-processing hacks
  - **Implementation quality**: Complete with 35 passing tests, full UI, metrics, logging
  - **Conclusion**: The right answer is "use V2", not "add optical flow"
- [x] V2 Temporal Window Tuning ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Experimental UI sliders for window size (16-64) and overlap (4-20)
  - Configurable via settings chain (UI → StereoProjector → VideoDepthEstimator)

- [x] Parallel frame processing ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Stereo pair generation parallelized with multiprocessing.Pool
  - Uses cpu_count() - 2 workers for optimal performance
- [x] Cache depth maps across runs ✓ (2026-01-17)
  - Implemented depth_cache.py with BLAKE2b content hashing
  - Caches in ~/.cache/depth-surge-3d/depth_cache
  - Skips re-computing if video and depth settings unchanged

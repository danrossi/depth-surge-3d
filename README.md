**Convert 2D videos to 3D VR format using AI depth estimation.**

Depth Surge 3D transforms flat videos into stereoscopic 3D for VR headsets using **Depth Anything V3** and **Video-Depth-Anything V2** neural networks. It analyzes video frames with temporal consistency to predict depth, then generates left and right eye views for immersive stereoscopic viewing.

## Key Features

- **Dual Depth Models**:
  - **Depth Anything V3** (default): 50% lower VRAM, faster processing, optimized for modern GPUs
  - **Video-Depth-Anything V2**: Superior temporal consistency with 32-frame sliding windows
- **AI Upscaling**: Optional Real-ESRGAN enhancement (2x/4x) for higher output resolution
- **CUDA Hardware Acceleration**: NVENC H.265 encoding and GPU-accelerated frame decoding
- **Configurable Depth Quality**: Adjustable depth map resolution (518px to 4K) for quality vs. speed
- **Multiple VR Formats**: Side-by-side and over-under stereoscopic formats
- **Flexible Resolutions**: Square (VR-optimized), 16:9 (standard), cinema, and custom resolutions up to 8K
- **Resume Capability**: Intelligent step-level resume for interrupted processing
- **Audio Preservation**: Maintains original audio synchronization with lossless FLAC extraction
- **Web Interface**: Modern browser-based UI with real-time progress tracking and live previews
- **Wide Format Support**: Cinema, ultra-wide, and standard aspect ratios

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tok/depth-surge-3d.git depth-surge-3d
cd depth-surge-3d
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script automatically installs all dependencies, downloads the Video-Depth-Anything model (~1.3GB), and verifies your system.

**See [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.**

### Usage

**Web UI (Recommended):**
```bash
./run_ui.sh
# Opens http://localhost:5000 in your browser
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Basic usage
python depth_surge_3d.py input_video.mp4

# Process specific time range with custom settings
python depth_surge_3d.py input_video.mp4 -s 01:30 -e 03:45 -f over_under --resolution 4k
```

**UV Command Line**

In WSL required to export a UV variable

```bash
export UV_LINK_MODE=copy
```

```bash
# Basic usage
uv run python depth_surge_3d.py input_video.mp4
```

**Quick Start Script:**
```bash
# Process a clip with optimized settings
./start.sh 1:11 2:22
```

**See [Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md) for comprehensive usage examples.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- FFmpeg
- CUDA 13.0+ (required for GPU acceleration)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but strongly recommended)

## Output Structure

Each processing session creates a self-contained timestamped directory:

```
output/
└── timestamp_videoname_timestamp/
    ├── original_video.mp4      # Source video
    ├── original_audio.flac     # Pre-extracted audio
    ├── frames/                 # Extracted frames
    ├── vr_frames/             # Final VR frames
    └── videoname_3D_side_by_side.mp4  # Final 3D video
```

## VR Viewing

Generated videos work with:
- VR headsets (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, etc.)
- Cardboard VR viewers
- 3D video players supporting side-by-side or over-under formats

## Performance

- **GPU Processing**: ~2-4 seconds per output frame (RTX 4070+ class)
- **CPU Processing**: ~30-60 seconds per output frame
- **Typical 1-minute clip**: ~2-4 hours on modern GPU at 60fps output

## Attribution

This project uses state-of-the-art depth estimation models:

- **[Depth Anything V3](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3)** - Default model with improved memory efficiency and performance
- **[Video-Depth-Anything V2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Video-Depth-Anything)** - Temporal-consistent depth estimation with 32-frame sliding windows

Both models are based on vision transformer architectures optimized for monocular depth prediction.

## Quality Expectations, Parallax-Glitchwave and Z-Collapse Slopcore Aesthetics

This tool converts monocular video to pseudo-stereo using AI depth estimation. Results can be compelling for many types of content but will never match true stereo cameras or specialized VR equipment.

**Best results with:**
- Clear depth variation (landscapes, interiors, people)
- Good lighting and detail
- Source resolution 1080p or higher
- Steady camera movement

**May struggle with:**
- Mirrors, glass, water reflections
- Very dark or low-contrast scenes
- Fast motion or rapid camera movements

**Artifact Embracement**: Expect algorithmic stereo divergence, synthetic depth layers, and monocular hallucinations. These AI-generated depth discontinuities create a unique aesthetic - depth-drift, disparity shimmer, and temporal judder may become part of the experience.

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed quality expectations and optimization tips.
